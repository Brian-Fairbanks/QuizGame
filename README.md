# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
[Hosted on Github](https://brian-fairbanks.github.io/QuizGame/.)

many of the questions used for this project were inspired by, or pulled from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/result.asp)

The goal of this project is to build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It aims to feature a clean and polished user interface, and be responsive( ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes).

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality, as demonstrated in the instructions:
